    <h1>A Basic Responsive Grid  (Plus Handy CSS3 Media Query Reporter)</h1>
    <div>
      <h3>The Magic is in the Media Query</h3>
      <p>With the advent of CSS3 Media Queries, we have the ability to create
         CSS rules designed specifically for a variety of screen sizes. These
         rules wait in the wing, only being called upon IF and WHEN the device
         fits the parameters of the media query. As Andy Clarke has written, in
         his excellent 320 and Up, these media queries make it possible to:
         load assets and layout styles progressively and only as theyâ€™re needed
         Thus, it becomes possible to produce a single "device agnostic, one
         web boilerplate" for your designs.</p>

      <h3>It's a Beautiful Thing</h3>
      <p>In this short tutorial, I'll provide both a basic review (or
        introduction) to the basic concepts of responsive design while building
         a handy CSS3 Media Query Reporter which you may find handy in your
          future design projects. (I know I have.) Then, using that reporter,
          we will take a first step toward converting a fixed-width grid system
          into a fluid and responsive grid system. We won't build the entire
          grid today, but we'll gain the concepts which will prepare us
          to do so.</p>
      <h5>What we'll do here:</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Start with a very basic grid.</li>
        <li>Create a little CSS3 Media Query Reporter.</li>
        <li>Make our grid fluid instead of fixed.</li>
        <li>Add a media query to help the grid adjust to small screen
          widths.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This will equip us with concepts and tools to help us tackle the
         bigger steps to come.</p>

      <h3>A CSS3 Media Query Reporter</h3>
      <p>One of the small challenges in building a responsive layout is deciding
         when to have certain rules apply. For instance, at what point will
         your site make the transition from a single narrow column for handheld
         devices to a multi-column design? Will you have one big transition
         (from one-column to many-column), or will you provide an intermediate
         step or two along the way (one-column, two-column, 8-column,
         and so on)? And if you want to supply intermediate steps -- WHEN will
          they apply? At 480 pixels wide ... 768 ... 1024? One thing that can
          be helpful in making these decisions is an on-screen media query
           reporter, which can provide visual feedback as we cross each width
           threshold.</p>
